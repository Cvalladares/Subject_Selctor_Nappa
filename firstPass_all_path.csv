Updated the app compat version to version 28 for bot hthe prefetching lib and the project itself.   Also changed the targetsdk to version 28 for the project (original 25) given that nappa has a 28 compile.

 CompileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility 1.8
        targetCompatibility 1.8
    }","Most of the queries made for this application are made by using Google’s Map SDK thus,  the only place where okhttp requests take place is in a single activity, which is ‘searching’ function.   This search function makes use of resources defined inside the activity itself, thus,  there are no intents to be intercepted (that are meaningful to the web prefetching)."
